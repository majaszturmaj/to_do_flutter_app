# To Do: Flutter App
Simple to do app which allows user to add and remove notes. It contains the main screen where is a list of notes or message if the list is empty. User can add note by clicking a button which is stateful widget changing icon when in main screen view or in add note view respectively. Add note is stateless widget where user can name and describe note.

My UI project made with Figma:

On bigger screen (running on for example Windows or desktop browser) it should look like this:

Or like this (I will see later)
